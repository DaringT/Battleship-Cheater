# Battleship Cheater

## About
The project was made because I have an electronic Battleship game and its code book it came with it. The book was full on preset grid-layouts and by hitting A1 - J10. 

This code takes all those grid-layouts and makes a heatmap of all the possible grid-layouts for any ship type and all of them summed together.  

# Installation
